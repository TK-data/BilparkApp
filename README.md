## Overview
Overall description of our task/project, what components are part of the solution and how they work together.

## Run Application
Steps to run our product package as a end-user.

## Development Setup
Do the following steps to set up and run the application for development. To make the application work properly, the backend has to be up and running.
### Backend
Install sails globally for the sails command to work:
```
npm i -g sails
```
To install the application, navigate to the backend folder and run:
```
npm install
```
To locally run the backend on your machine, navigate to the backend folder, and serve it with:
```
sails lift
```

### React Native Application
First point to the address of the machine that is running the backend:
```
goto BilparkApp\src\config
duplicated connections.js.example and rename it connections.js
edit the API_ADDRESS
save
```

You need the [Expo app](https://expo.io) to run the app on mobile devices.
```
cd BilparkApp
npm install
npm start
```
Use the Expo app to scan the QR code shown in the terminal.

### Dashboard React Application

## Sailsjs Backend Description
Our back-end is based on [Sails](https://sailsjs.com/), an MVC and API framework that builds upon Express.js for Node.js

## Linting
<img

width="50%" height="auto">

We use [ESLint]() to ensure code standards. The rules are defined in [Backend/.eslintrc](Backend/.eslintrc) and [BilparkApp/.eslintrc](BilparkApp/.eslintrc).

For setup: Install "linter" and "linter-eslint" in Atom. For other text editors, search for similar solutions.


## Continous Integration
<img src="https://travis-ci.com/images/logos/TravisCI-Full-Color.png" width="50%" height="auto">

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), a tool for Continuous Integration, to run our tests and upload code coverage reports to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/).

Travis is activated on the repository and project/language specific settings are specified in the [.travis.yml](.travis.yml).

To make our workflow support continous delivery, we've added the option to automatically deploy pull requests when they are made to dev and master branch, using [Appr](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/appr).
When we use this, it automatically posts a link and QR code to the pull request, so we can run the app on our device on emulator.


## Deployment
We use [Expo](https://expo.io) to deploy our application. Login with your Expo account using `exp login`

### Android Deployment
- Run `exp build:android`
- Wait for build to finnish
- Copy/paste link in browser to download APK.
- Drag and drop .apk file into emulator, or download/transfer it to an Android Device.
- (Upload .apk to Google Play Store)

#### To run on your connected Android Device:
- `brew cask install android-platform-tools`
- [Enable USB debugging on your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html#device-developer-options)
- Connect device
- `adb install app-filename.apk`

### iOS Deployment
- Need to have an Apple Developer Account
- Run `exp build:ios`
